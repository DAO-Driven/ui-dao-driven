      "text": "In the dynamic world of Web3 and blockchain technologies, project refactoring becomes a critical service. Whether due to algorithm adjustments, methodological changes, or shifts in the application's core functionality, your software will occasionally require updating. It could be driven by the evolution of technologies, redesigning of software features, or performance optimization needs. If the software's performance starts to lag, a thorough analysis and fix are imperative to maintain high-quality services. Additionally, when your deployed software requires an upgrade or a new feature, we are there to facilitate the process"

This innovative dashboard empowers users to participate in the Archway network by staking coins and providing liquidity through a variety of smart contracts. <br /><br /><strong>Key Features:</strong><br /><br /> - <strong>Stacking and Liquidity Management:</strong> The platform provides users with a user-friendly interface to stake their coins and provide liquidity using different smart contracts within the Archway network. Users have the flexibility to choose which contract and coin they want to stake, supporting the Archway network while promoting their chosen contract.<br /><br /> - <strong>CosmWasm Wallet Integration:</strong> To streamline the user experience, I integrated a CosmWasm wallet directly into the user's web browser. This enables seamless and secure transactions, making it easy for users to manage their assets and interact with the Archway network. <br /><br /> - <strong>Network Statistics:</strong> The dashboard includes a robust set of tools for users to access network statistics. Users can track the performance and activity of different contracts and wallets within the Archway ecosystem. This data empowers users with valuable insights to make informed decisions",

The first handles straightforward activities using existing account balances, while the second, accounts boosting, efficiently manages funds by collecting them at OKX exchange and distributing them to accounts as needed. Once activities are completed, funds are returned to OKX for the next account in line. <br /><br /> <strong>Flexible Configuration:</strong> Users have the power to fine-tune their experience, customizing settings for the number of accounts managed, the use of account balances, and the adjustment of hunting strategies through contract additions or deletions. This flexibility allows for diversified activities and unique account configurations. <br /><br /> <strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> To ensure account anonymity, the software employs advanced privacy technologies similar to those found in AdsPower software, safeguarding accounts against de-anonymization threats. <br /><br /> This project underscores the proficiency in software development for blockchain automation, L2 network management, and privacy protection, establishing it as a valuable asset in the portfolio",
